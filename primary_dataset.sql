 Create primary dataset "t_martin_kalkus_project_SQL_primary_final"
 This selection query retrieves data from multiple tables to generate a report on payroll information.
 The query filters the data from the 'czechia_payroll' table based on the 'value_type_code' column.
 It then joins the filtered data with other tables to retrieve additional information such as industry, payroll, product details, price, quantity, and unit.
 The final result set includes columns for date, industry, payroll, product_id, product, price, quantity, and unit.
